Code compiles without any issues and everything seems to run smoothly
I noticed the simplicity of this program but the comments in the code helped explain that there were issues with the class library so that makes sense.
Doesn’t have any sorting or filtering 
The design is pretty simple but I its understandable and runs smoothly.
The code itself is also understandable and it doesn’t lack comments so I was able to understand each line of code was doing
I like how he prevented the user from being able to create a record using the navigator but instead, it opens up the add state form (I was a bit confused where it was because I noticed it in the code but I guess I expected a button for it instead of the add button on the binding navigator)
If a record is deleted using the binding navigator, a message box pops up to make sure that the user is sure of their decision (definitely a good idea because it makes it much more user friendly)
Although the design is a bit basic (not much was changed from the default), it still looks nice because the text is bold
Maybe change the background color? That and sorting/filtering is the only thing that I would suggest working on, but the program looks good
I also like how once a state is chosen in the dropbox, it immediately switches over to the state details form without needing a button to open that form (this may be a bit simple, but it makes the main form look much cleaner and simpler without the extra button)
I can’t really pick if I would prefer this program or mine because I like both, but I think I would prefer some things in mine over this one and vice versa.
Overall, great program! Using the add button on the binding navigator definitely stood out to me and I think it was a great addition to keep the form from being overcrowded with buttons
