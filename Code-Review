The Code Compiles without any issues and run smooth. I like the simplicity of the layout as well as the amount of comments left in the code. The code was very clear and not really any rendunancies that I saw. I'm not a big fan of the way you add a state since the button is tied to the report. I think it's actually pretty cool and innovative but it was hard to find
so I struggled with adding a state. The app is very user friendly and even includes confirmation before deleting a row of data. Very Great job, only criqiue would be the adding state being more clear and maybe adding some color to the app. Overall a very good job!
